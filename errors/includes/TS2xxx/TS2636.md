## TS2636

> error TS2636: Type '`Func<super-T>`' is not assignable to type '`Func<sub-T>`' as implied by variance annotation. Type '`super-T`' is not assignable to type '`sub-T`'.

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
type Func<in T> = () => T
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

Variance annotations on type variables must be consistent with their position. If a type variable is at output (read) position, it should be annotated with `out`:

```ts
type Func<out T> = () => T
```

Alternatively, you can annotate it with both `in` and `out` (i.e. as invariant):

```ts
type Func<in out T> = () => T
```
