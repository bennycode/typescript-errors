## TS2476

> error TS2476: A const enum member can only be accessed using a string literal.

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
const enum OrderSide {
  BUY = 'buy',
  SELL = 'sell',
}

console.log(OrderSide[0]);
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

Constant enumerations can only be accessed using key names:

```ts
const enum OrderSide {
  BUY = 'buy',
  SELL = 'sell',
}

console.log(OrderSide.BUY);
```

If you want to access enums by indices, you must remove the `const` keyword and values from your `enum`:

```ts
enum OrderSide {
  BUY,
  SELL,
}

console.log(OrderSide[0]);
```

⚠️ Be aware that this may become unsafe as you may unintentionally access indices that are not defined.
