## TS2540

> error TS2540: Cannot assign to '`name`' because it is a read-only property.

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
const user = {name: 'Benny'} as const;
user.name = 'Sofia';
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

The `user` object has been initialized with a const assertion, indicating to the compiler that the object is immutable. If you wish to reintroduce mutability, you have to remove the const assertion:

```ts
const user = {name: 'Benny'};
user.name = 'Sofia';
```
