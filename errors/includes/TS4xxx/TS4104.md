## TS4104

> error TS4104: The type '`readonly [1, 2, 3]`' is 'readonly' and cannot be assigned to the mutable type '`[1, 2, 3]`'.

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
const array: [1, 2, 3] = [1, 2, 3] as const;
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

Using a **const assertion** makes your array immutable, so you have to use the `readonly` modifier for its type:

```ts
const array: readonly [1, 2, 3] = [1, 2, 3] as const;
```

Alternative:

```ts
const array: Readonly<[1, 2, 3]> = [1, 2, 3] as const;
```

Alternative #2:

```ts
const array: ReadonlyArray<number> = [1, 2, 3] as const;
```
