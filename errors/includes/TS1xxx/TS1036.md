## TS1036

> error TS1036: Statements are not allowed in ambient contexts.

### Broken Code ❌

```ts
import {APIClient} from '../../APIClient';

declare global {
  client: APIClient;
}
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

With `declare global` an [ambient context](/glossary/index.html#Ambient-Context) is created. TypeScript does not allow statements in such ambient context declaration which is why we have to change the statement into a declaration:

```ts
declare global {
  function client(): APIClient;
}
```

If you don't want `client` to be a `function, you have to use the `var` keyword:

```ts
declare global {
  var client: APIClient;
}
```
