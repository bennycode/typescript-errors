## TS5087

> error TS5087: A labeled tuple element is declared as rest with a '`...`' before the name, rather than before the type.

### Broken Code ❌

```bash
type Operation = "+" | "-";

type CalcInput = [operation: Operation, numbers: ...number[]];
```

### Fixed Code ✔️

We have to move the rest operator to the label name:

```bash
type CalcInput = [operation: Operation, ...numbers: number[]];
```
